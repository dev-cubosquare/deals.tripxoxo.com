                    <strong>RIGHT TO REFUSE :</strong>
                    <br><br>

                    Without prejudice to the other remedies available to TRIPXOXO under this agreement, the TOS or under
                    applicable law, TRIPXOXO may limit the user's activity, or end the user's listing, warn other users

                    registration, and/or refuse to provide the user with access to the website if:
                    <br><br>
                    The user is in breach of this agreement, the TOS and/or the documents it incorporates by reference;
                    TRIPXOXO is unable to verify or authenticate any information provided by the user; or
                    TRIPXOXO believes that the user's actions may infringe on any third party rights or breach any

                    <br><br>

                    requesting for any services under this agreement, and not to make any misrepresentation of facts at

                    <br><br>
                    In case TRIPXOXO discovers or has reasons to believe at any time during or after receiving a request
                    for services from the User that the request for services is either unauthorized or the information
                    provided by the User or any of them is not correct or that any fact has been misrepresented by him,
                    TRIPXOXO in its sole discretion shall have the unrestricted right to take any steps against the
                    User(s), including cancellation of the bookings, etc. without any prior intimation to the User. In
                    such an event, TRIPXOXO shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage that may be caused
                    to the User or any of them as a consequence of such cancellation of booking or services.
                    <br><br>
                    The User unequivocally indemnifies TRIPXOXO of any such claim or liability and shall not hold
                    TRIPXOXO responsible for any loss or damage arising out of measures taken by TRIPXOXO for
                    safeguarding its own interest and that of its genuine customers. This would also include TRIPXOXO
                    denying/cancelling any bookings on account of suspected fraud transactions.

                    <strong>MODIFICATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE :</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    TRIPXOXO reserves the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices under which the TRIPXOXO

                    <strong>JURISDICTION :</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    TRIPXOXO hereby expressly disclaims any implied warranties imputed by the laws of any jurisdiction
                    or country other than those where it is operating its offices. TRIPXOXO considers itself and intends

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>RESPONSIBILITIES OF USER AGREEMENT :</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The User expressly agrees that use of the services is at their sole risk. To the extent TRIPXOXO
                    acts only as a booking agent on behalf of third party service providers, it shall not have any
                    liability whatsoever for any aspect of the standards of services provided by the service providers.
                    In no circumstances shall TRIPXOXO be liable for the services provided by the service provider. The
                    services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. TRIPXOXO may change the features or
                    functionality of the services at any time, in their sole discretion, without notice. TRIPXOXO
                    expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not
                    limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
                    non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, which the User obtains from
                    TRIPXOXO or through the services shall create any warranty not expressly made herein or in the terms
                    and conditions of the services. If the User does not agree with any of the terms above, they are
                    advised not to read the material on any of the TRIPXOXO pages or otherwise use any of the contents,
                    pages, information or any other material provided by TRIPXOXO. The sole and exclusive remedy of the
                    User in case of disagreement, in whole or in part, of the user agreement, is to discontinue using
                    the services after notifying TRIPXOXO in writing.
                    <br><br>
