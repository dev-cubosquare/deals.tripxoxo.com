                        You do not need an account in order to book with TripXOXO. When you submit a booking, you will
                        receive an email receipt with the basic details of your booking and a timeframe. Once your
                        booking is confirmed - some tours are confirmed immediately, while others will be confirmed by
                        the local supplier within 48 hours - you’ll receive another email with your ticket voucher. Be
                        sure to keep these emails if you need to refer to any information about your booking!

                        You can search tours and activities on TripXOXO in the below way<br><br>
                        If you know what type of activity you’re looking for, you can simply enter that term into the
                        search field at the top of any TripXOXO page. For example, if you know you want to visit the
                        Eiffel Tower in Paris, you could enter “Eiffel Tower” in the search field. Your search results
                        will automatically be sorted by popularity, with our most-booked tours listed first.

                    <p>
                        First, visit the page of the activity you would like to book. Select the date you wish to go on
                        the activity by clicking the calendar icon under the "Availability" heading on this page. Dates
                        in green are still available while dates in red are no longer available; click on the date you
                        wish to book.<br><br>

                        Second, click the green "Book now" button. Please note that some tours have multiple options -
                        for example, an excursion that can be taken either as a public group or as a private tour at
                        different prices - so you may see more than one “Book now” button. Be sure to click the booking
                        button for the option you wish to reserve. You will then be prompted to select your desired
                        starting time (if applicable) and the number of participants in your group. Then click "Add to
                        cart."<br><br>

                        On the following page, review your selected booking information, and click the green "Proceed to
                        checkout" button to enter your payment details (if applicable).<br><br>

                        Hotel Pick-Up<br>
                        If the supplier offers hotel pick-ups, please add your hotel name and address to the field for
                        “Address of your hotel or accommodation.”
                        <br><br>
                        Transfers<br>
                        If you are booking a transfer, please enter your flight details and times in the field “Remarks
                        for the local operator.”
                        <br><br>
                        Once you submit your booking, the local supplier of the tour will confirm your reservation
                        within 48 hours, and you will receive a ticket voucher via email. Please print your voucher and
                        bring it, along with a valid photo ID for the traveler named on the ticket, to the meeting point
                        stipulated on your voucher when you attend. Please be aware that some activities will also
                        require a valid ID for each participant, but this will be stated on the ticket.

                        <br><br>
                        Keep in mind that TripXOXO is located in India, and some banks and credit cards may charge a
                        transaction fee for international payments. Please contact your card provider directly for
                        further information about transaction fees.

                    <p>
                        Yes. By using our secure online payment system, your payment information is encrypted, you are
                        secured against fraud, and you can make date changes or early cancellations at no cost (please

                        Please note that your credit card/PayPal account will be charged upon booking. If the local tour
                        operator does not accept your booking, the charged amount will be credited back to the account
                        from which the charge was drawn.

                <div class="q">
                    <p>10. After I make a booking, how long will I wait to receive my voucher?</p>

                    <p>
                        This depends on your booking. Some activities are automatically confirmed as soon as you submit
                        your booking. Most activities on TripXOXO require manual confirmation from the supplier. These
                        activities will be confirmed within 48 hours. Please be aware that some suppliers do not have
                        office hours on the weekend, so weekend bookings may take a little longer to receive a
                        confirmation.
                        <br><br>
                        What do I get after I book?<br>
                        After booking you'll receive two emails from us. Here's what to expect:
                        <br><br>
                        1) Receipt: Right after you book, we'll email you a receipt to confirm your booking submission
                        and payment. Keep in mind that the receipt is not the same as the confirmation you get in step
                        two.
                        <br><br>
                        2) Confirmation + Voucher: As soon as your booking is confirmed, you’ll receive another email
                        with a link to your voucher. If your activity has instant booking, you will get your
                        confirmation and voucher quite quickly. If your activity is on-demand, there will be a short
                        wait time for the supplier to confirm your booking.
                        <br><br>
                        It’s a good idea to keep these emails for your records. Your voucher is especially important
                        because it contains the details of the activity departure location and contact information for
                        the local supplier in case of an emergency.
                        <br><br>
                        If you need to find your voucher again, it’s easy: just log in to your Customer Profile on
                        TripXOXO.in and navigate to "Bookings." There, you'll see all of your past and upcoming bookings
                        and vouchers.

                    <p>
                        If you need to contact us about your booking, you’ll need to provide us with your reference
                        number so that we can find your booking details. Your reference number can be found in both the
                        email receipt you receive after submitting a booking, and in the confirmation email you receive
                        once your tour has been confirmed. Your reference number always begins with the letters “TPXO.”

                        If you need to make any changes to your booking - such as removing a participant, changing the
                        tour date or time, or editing your contact information, please contact TripXOXO via phone, Live
                        Chat, or email. You can find more information about contacting us here:

                        If you are removing participants, or changing the date or time of your tour, we will need to
                        contact the local supplier to confirm that they can accommodate the change. If you simply need
                        to change your contact information, we’ll be able to take care of that for you ourselves right
                        away!
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that some venues/local suppliers cannot accept cancellations or date/time changes
                        for a booking that has already been confirmed. Any non-standard refund or cancellation policies
                        from the tour operator are stated on the tour page.

                        You will need to bring a copy of your ticket voucher (all local suppliers accept printed copies;

                        traveler named on the ticket (some activities will also require a valid ID for each participant
                        but this will be stated on the ticket).
                        <br><br>
                        Some activities require or recommend additional items to bring with you: for example, driving
                        excursions generally require a valid driver’s license, while outdoor or sporting activities may
                        require or recommend specific gear to ensure your comfort and safety (rain gear, water bottles,
                        swimsuits, etc). Please check both your voucher and the activity details page where you booked
                        for more information from the supplier about what’s required or recommended for your activity.

                        Of course! If you are purchasing an activity for someone else, you can enter that person’s
                        information on the checkout page when you enter your reservation details.
                        <br><br>
                        On the checkout page, first please enter your own information in the billing details form. Then,
                        in the “Traveller (Details on the ticket)” form, un-click the checkbox next to “Same as billing
                        details.” This will open a new form where you can enter the name, email, and phone number of the
                        lead traveller who will actually be going on the activity.
                        <br><br>
                        Please note that the booking confirmation and ticket voucher will be sent to the email address
                        provided on the billing details form. The email in the traveler form will be used by the local
                        supplier for important communication prior to the tour.
